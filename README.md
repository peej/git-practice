# Git Practice Project

## What?

This repository contains an example set of files and commits which you will improve by using your git skills.

The person who creating the commits in this project could have done a better job so as to make the project history
clearer for other developers joining the project. Your job is to rewrite the project history to improve it anyway you
seem fit.

### Things to think about

* Does each commit serve a single purpose or should it be split up?
* Does each commit add something meaningful to the history or should it be squashed into another?
* Is the order of the commits logical?
* Do the commit messages make sense and contain useful information?

## How?

Fork and clone this project. Rewrite the commit history as you see fit and then (force) push your changes to your fork
and create a pull request back to this project.
